### Welcome to my very first blog post. 


I’ve decided that these blog posts will mostly focus on two areas that I am passionate about, which are world travel and good food. I first would like to start off by acknowledging how grateful I am to have had the opportunity to travel to some amazing countries, so I thought it would be nice to share some of my experiences. So let’s start off with the former, and begin with where I am currently living which is beautiful Izmir, Turkey. I moved to Izmir from New York in March of 2015, and can genuinely say that I much prefer it to the hustle and bustle of New York City (for sure it’s a weather upgrade), where I had been living for almost 5 years prior. Therefore, for my first post I decided to write about the place I’ve called home now for the last 4 years. 

Izmir, Turkey is a coastal city and the third largest after Istanbul and Ankara, with a population of close to 4 million (sorry if that sentence sounded straight from a text-book, but it helps to get an idea for those who aren’t familiar with Turkey). It’s a city that sits on the Western coast of Turkey and is usually referred to as the Aegean region (Ege as it’s called in Turkish), as it borders the Aegean Sea. Geographically speaking, it’s very close to Greece. Hop on a ferry from the port of Çeşme, and in about 30 minutes you’re in Chios (a small Greek island with amazing seafood, but that can be another post in and of itself). 

Anyways, back to Izmir. Izmir’s population generally speaking has a more Western-cultured ambiance, in terms of its lifestyle, people, architecture, etc. There are many great places to visit while here, Çeşme for the beach, Alaçatı for some fancy dining and walks along the cobblestone streets and vintage shopping, and Alsancak for bars and active nightlife. I’m especially into a neighborhood called Urla, which has a nostalgic street call Urla Sanat Sokağı (meaning Urla Art Street) which has a lively artistic community with local vendors selling their homemade wares (my husband almost always ends up buying handmade leather bracelets there). There’s also some delicious local wines produced from Urlice, a winery that I have yet to go to but have heard good things about. 

One place that I highly recommend is Şirince, a small village located at the top of a mountain just outside of Izmir, where small shops line the cobblestone pathways and serve homemade fruit wines, with flavors such as pear, strawberry, peach, black mulberry, and my favorite, quince! Sampling these fruit wines is free of charge, but I usually always end up buying a bottle or two, as they make nice gifts. You can also sit down for a nice meal and buy some homemade textiles or olive oil soap. Very close by, in a city called Selçuk, is the ancient Greek/Roman architectural site known as Ephesus (Efes in Turkish). I’ve been several times (a touristic must see for history lovers), and always enjoy walking around and seeing the impressive Library of Celsus (but beware of going in July/August, as it can be extremely hot at that time). 

So there you have it, a little bit about where I live and what areas I have enjoyed the most. Of course there are lots of other places to visit while in Izmir and in Turkey in general, but at the risk of making this post too long, I thought I would just cover some of the basics. Until next time!
